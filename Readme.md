    Question 6
    Difference between statically typed and dynamically typed programming language and examples

Dynamically typed programming language performs type checking at run time while statically typed languages perform type checking at compile time. This means that Scripts written in dynamically typed languages can be compiled even if they have errors that will prevent the Script from running properly. If a Script is written statically and it contrains error, it will fail to compile until the errors are fixed.

Another difference is that,statically typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them while dynamically typed languages do not

Examples of dynamically typed languages are; Groovy, JavaScript,PHP, Python,Ruby
Examples of statically typed languages are; Java,C, C++,C#, Scala

Question 7
Difference between JavaScript data types null and undefined &nbsp
In JavaScript, Undefined as a type means a variable is declared but no value has been assigned to it, whereas null in JavaScript is an assignment value, meaning you can assign it to a variable. In JavaScrpt also, undefined is a type whereas null is an object.

&nbspis a non-breaking space that prevents line breaks from occurring at a particular point in an HTML document. Non-breaking space is used inprogramming language to create space in a line that cannot be word wrap. With HTML, nbsp lets ypu create multiple spaces that are visible on a web page and not only in the source code.
